# Graphs
This repository contains C++ implementations of fundamental Graph algorithms for competitive programming and DSA preparation. Each file is well-structured and tested for clarity and correctness.

## Algorithms Included

-  Disjoint Set Union (DSU) with Union by Rank and Path Compression
-  Dijkstra’s Algorithm
-  Bellman-Ford Algorithm
-  Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
-  Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
-  Kruskal’s MST Algorithm
-  Euler Path in Directed/Undirected Graph
-  Hierholzer's Algorithm for Eulerian Circuit

## Folder Structure

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate `.cpp` file:
